    ## motor vehicules and saving it to dataint2
    ## Loading plyr library to use ddply for summing amount of PM2.5 emission in tons
    ## by year. data obtained is stored in new dataset called data5
    ## whose first column shows the year and the second total
    ## emission of above pollutant that year. Columns are labeled accordingly.

    ## scipen option is used here to avoid scientif expressions in plot. plot 1 uses base plotting 
    ## system and plots a titled bar plot with duely labeled x- and y-axis. A comment box is included 
    ## on the plot. The plot is then saved in CWD under png file named plot1.png. With a subtitle.
