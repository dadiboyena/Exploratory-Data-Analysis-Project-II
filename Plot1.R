## Plot I
----------
    ## Loading plyr library to use ddply for summing amount of PM2.5 emission in tons by year. 
    ## Data obtained is stored in new dataset called data1 whose first column shows the year 
    ## and second total emission of above pollutant that year. 
    ## Columns are labeled accordingly.


library(plyr)
data1 <- ddply(NEI, .(as.factor(year)), summarize,tot=sum(as.numeric(Emissions)))
names(data1)[1] <- "Year"

    ## scipen option is used here to avoid scientific expressions in plot. plot 1 uses base 
    ## plotting system and plots a titled bar plot with duely labeled x- & y-axis. 
    ## A comment box is included on the plot. The plot is then saved in CWD under png file named plot1.png.
